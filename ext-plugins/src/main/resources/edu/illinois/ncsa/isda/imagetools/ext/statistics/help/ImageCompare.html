        <h2>Image Compare</h2>

        <p>Even though to the human eye two images look the same there can be
            some minute
            differences, this dialog will allow the user to select a comparison
            method to
            compare two images and visualize the minute differences between the
            images. The
            tool will allow the user to load a test image, a mask (or use a
            predefined
            mask) and test method, as well as a multiplier for the result image
            and the
            type of the result image.</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="imagecompare.png"><br>
            Figure: Image Compare Dialog.</p>

            <p>
                The dialog shows all these options. To perform a comparison the
                user must first
                select an image to compare the current image in the mainfram
                against using the
                "Load Test" button. This will show a dialog allowing the user to
                load an image.
                To make sure the right image is loaded the user can show the
                test image using
                the "Show Test" button.</p>

            <p>
                Next the user has to decide which mask to use. The user can use
                one of the
                predefined masks or load a custom mask. The predefined mask will
                create a mask
                image that splits the original image in squares of the selected
                size, from 1x1
                (pixel) to 100x100 size squares. If the user selected "Load
                Mask" a dialog will
                appear allowing the user to load an image to be used as a mask.
                Only the first
                band of this mask image wil be used! The user can check the mask
                by clicking on
                the "Show Mask" button. Some masks however don't work well with
                certain
                comparison methods (for instance pixel (or 1x1) does not work
                with histogram
                test.</p>

            <p>Next the user has to select which test to use. The user can
                choose one of the
                following test:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Subtract</dt>
                <dd>
                    For each region and band, as defined by the mask, this
                    routine will calculate
                    the average for both the original and the test and subtract
                    them from each
                    other. The result image will contain the difference in that
                    region. Setting the
                    mask to 1x1 will result in the difference per pixel for the
                    image and test
                    image.</dd>
                <dt>Correlation</dt>
                <dd>
                    This will calculate the Pearson linnear correlation for each
                    band and mask
                    value. Currently only the pearon value is calculated
                    correctly. If the mask is
                    set to pixel ((1x1) it will compute the correlation per band
                    over the whole
                    image. There is no resulting image.</dd>
                <dt>Histogram</dt>
                <dd>
                    For each band and region in the mask image, we create a
                    histogram of all
                    values. After normalization we calculate the percentage of
                    pixels that are
                    placed in one bin, but should be in another. The resulting
                    image will have this
                    percentage.</dd>
                <dt>Chi Square RGB and Chi Square HSV</dt>
                <dd>
                    This will compute the CHI-Square value on a per band and
                    mask region. The
                    resulting CHI-Square value will be returned in the result
                    image. We have
                    observed that for images with small changes (i.e. a red
                    scratch in the image)
                    the CHI-Square value will be large enough to result in a
                    probability of 0.</dd>
                <dt>Tuple</dt>
                <dd>
                    This will create a subimage by taking the 3 highest bits of
                    the first, second
                    and the 2 highest bits of the third band and combine them
                    into a 8 bit byte.
                    Next it performs a CHI-Square test for each mask region and
                    band on this
                    subimage and the subimage created from the testimage in
                    simmilar way. The
                    result image will contain the CHI-Square value for each mask
                    region.</dd>
                <dt>Long Chi Square RGB</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is the same as Tuple except that instead of only using
                    a few bits we
                    concatenate the first, second and third byte of both images
                    and perform a
                    CHI-Square test on each of these new images. The resulting
                    CHI-Square value
                    will be put in the resulting image.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>Finally the user can use the Multiplier and Image Output fields
                to select what
                imagetype the resulting image will be and what multiplier needs
                to be used when
                comparing the images. For instance to create an BYTE image of
                the Histogram we
                need a multiplier of 255 since the original range of values will
                be between 0
                and 1.</p>

            <p>The user can save the result of the comparison as an image using
                the "Save
                Image" button.
