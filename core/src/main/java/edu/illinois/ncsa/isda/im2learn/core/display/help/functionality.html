<h1>Im2Learn Functionality</h1>
<p>The Im2Learn - Image to Learn is capable of
analyzing multidimensional, multi-variate (multi-band) image data and
enables user interaction with the data. The basic set of Im2Learn
tools also provides support for histograms, image band ranking, image
statistics, correlation matching, filtering, contour extraction,
image calculator, tracking, blob analysis, image thresholding,
segmentation and Isodata clustering. The input and output interface
can handle loading and saving of individual images in several
standard file formats. The current support of standard input image
file formats includes: jpg, gif, tif (Ver. 6.0 with no compression),
pgm, ppm, bmp, png, pnm, img, and an internal image format denoted as
iip (image interleaved pixels).  The software also supports some of
the file formats used in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS), such
as, USGS DEM (Float), ESRI IMG format, HDF4, HDF5, LAN, GeoTiff and
ESRI Shape file format. All GIS related files are loaded with their
georeferencing information that is used for geo-registration of
raster and vector data sets. The input can be a sequence of images
(e.g., video frames) or a combination of bands from several image
data sources in multiple standard file formats.</p>
