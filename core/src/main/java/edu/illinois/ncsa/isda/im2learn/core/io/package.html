Provides for readers and writers of image file formats. This package will allow
Im2Learn to read and write different fileformats. The FileChoose is a smart file
chooser in the sense that it understands that certain fileformats can have
multiple files archived inside a single file (such as HDF). It will show an
additional dialogue asking the user for a specific file inside this archive.
