<h1>Coding Style</h1>

<p>This document will help with a few guidelines on how to write code such that
it is easier for others to understand, maintain and extend. The code should be
grouped in directories that combine similar code, for instance all the code that
deal with hyperspectral images is in one directory.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>Im2Learn being a large project on which many people work, some useful coding
guides will help make it easier for others to extends your code. The first step
to this is documentation. There are two types of documentation that needs to
be written. One is the javadoc that is with the code, this is the documentation
that developers will use. Next is the user documentation. Each dialog and module
should have a document explaining how to use it.</p>

<h2>javadoc</h2>

<p>
<p>All your code should have javdoc explaining what a
function does, what parameters it takes and what the result is. If the function
throws any exceptions try not to use <code>Exception</code> instead use
ImageException, or subclass ImageException to create a specific exception. For
For a description of javadoc and the tags see:
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/</a>
</p>

<p>Images for the javadoc are kept in the source tree. At the same directory
where the source code lives, a directory called doc-files is created. In this
directory you store any images that are relevant to the class. The images
should be named class-x.[gif/jpg] (where x is an increasing number). When you
want to reference them in your javadoc, simply use
&lt;img src="doc-files/class-x.jpg"&gt;.</p>

<p>Directories are now grouped logically. Simmilar tasks belong in the same
directory, for instance all masking methods, or all hyperspectral methods. To
explain what the files in the directory do, a file called package.html is in
each directory. When creating javadoc, this file will be used to describe the
package itself. Following is a simple package.html file.</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor="white"&gt;

Oneliner about package. Bigger description about package. This will be used
when generating javadocs.

@since 2.0

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<h1>Code Guidelines</h1>

<p>All variables should be private or protected and have simple getters/setters.
Using these simple getters (just immediatly return the variable) or setters
(set the variable no computation) will have minimal speed impact. This way if
you do need to do some computation to make sure the internal data of the class
is valid you can do it, and the developer can not invalidate this by modifying
other variables in the class.
</p>

<h1>UI Guidelines</h1>

<p>Any images used by the classfile are placed in the source tree with the class
  that uses the images. You can access the images using
  classname.class.getResource("image.gif"); this will return a URL.</p>

<p>All dialogs in Im2Learn, including the menus you add to Im2Learn, will have  their class
end with Dialog. The UserInterface should as much as possible try and  use the
Swing framework, advantage of the Swing framework is that it matches  closer the
native windowing environment of the user.</p>

<p>As a general guideline it is best to extend JDialog if you want to  create a
user interface. Have the constructor take a Frame as argument and call
<code>super(frame, "title")</code> in the constructor. In the ncsa.im2learn.main  class create
a new instance of your extention passing the Im2LearnMainFrame as argument.  Now if
the user minimizes the ncsa.im2learn.main panel, your extention will minimize as  well.</p>

<p>The disadventage of a dialog is that it will be on top, so if you  bring the
mainframe to the front your dialog will be on top. If this behavious is  not
acceptable extends JFrame.</p>
