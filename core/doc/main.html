<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Im2Learn is a toolkit created by the ISDA group to manipulate
images. The core of the toolkit understands images of different types (BYTE,
INT, SHORT, LONG, FLOAT and DOUBLE) and different sizes (rows, columns and
bands) and has a component that can render these images and can be included in
any Java Swing application. The core provides different loaders and writers for
different fileformats (IIP, PNM, TIFF, JPG, HDF, etc).</p>
