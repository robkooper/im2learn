<h1>HelpEntry</h1>
<p>The Im2Learn system comes with a
build in help system. By using the HelpEntry interface the developer
can create help that is specific for the code that is written and add
it to the build in help system. The help system for Im2Learn is a
tree of nodes, each node can have subnodes and so on. When the user
clicks on a node, the help system will first check to see if this
node is a leaf node (i.e. no subnodes are available), if this is the
case the system will find the class that added the leaf node to the
help system and ask for a URL to the help documentation.</p>
<p>The URL that is returned can be
either a URL to a webpage outside of Im2Learn or, the preferred
method, a URL that points to a HTML file that is shipped with
Im2Learn. The easiest method for the developer to create a URL to the
help page, is to place the HTML file, and all associated images, in a
directory called help. In the code the developer can than point to
the HTML file using <code>this.getClass().getResource(&quot;help/file.html&quot;)</code>.
Using this code will make sure that the help file can be found even
if the class files (and the HTML and image files) are put in a jar
file for distribution.</p>
