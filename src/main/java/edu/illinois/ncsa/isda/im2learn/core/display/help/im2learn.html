        <p> The "Menu" help topic contains information about the many tools and 
        abilities of Im2Learn.  The menu section is organized systematically 
        around the structure of the menu bar, so that the user can quickly find 
        out what any item does.  Additionally, Im2Learn is built to be extensible 
        through a plugin architecture.  The [P] in some of the help topic names 
        indicates that the functionality is a plugin and might not always be 
        available.  For information on how to extend Im2Learn, please see How to 
        use Im2Learn->Extending Im2Learn section.
