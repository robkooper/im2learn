<h1>ImageLoader</h1>
<p>To load an image from disk or to
save an image to disk the developer can use the <code>ImageLoader</code>
class. This class has static methods <code>readImage</code>
methods that will take a String as argument that points to the file
that needs to be loaded. The ImageLoader class will then use the
loaders provided to find the best loader to load the image. When
saving an image the developer can call <code>writeImage</code>
with the ImageObject and the filename as a String. Again the
ImageLoader will find the best writer to save the image.</P>
<p>The ImageLoader can be extended to
include new readers and writers by the application developer. To do
this the extension will need to implement the ImageReader class to be
able to load images and the ImageWriter class to write images to
disk.</p>
