<h1>Adding Functionality</h1>
<p>To add new functionality to
Im2Learn the developer will need to implement the <code>Im2LearnMenu</code>
interface. This interface tells the Im2Learn system the names of the
menus to be added to the mainframe. Once the plugin is added to an
imagepanel the reference to this imagepanel is passed back to the
plugin, allowing the plugin to get the ImageObject currently shown.
To be able to add help to the central helpsystem of Im2Learn the
plugin needs to implement the <code>HelpEntry</code>
interface. Examples of the Im2LearnMenu implementation and HelpEntry
can be found in the next two sections. A full example of a plugin for
Im2Learn can be found in Example Plugin.</p>
