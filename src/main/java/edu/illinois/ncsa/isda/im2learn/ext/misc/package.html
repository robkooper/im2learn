<p>Miscallanous packages using in Im2Learn. In this package are classes that are used
by multiple other classes, but do not belong to a single package, for instance
support classes that are used by many other classes, or classes that do not
easily fit within other packages. If the class is in this pacakge and used by
many others, it will in the most likely move to the Im2Learn core in the near
future.</p>
