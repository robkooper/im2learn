<h1>Im2Learn Code Architecture</h1>
<p>Im2Learn code is decomposed into
several components such as Im2Learn core, Im2Learn extensions
(re-usable plugins), Im2Learn main (custom configuration files), test
routines, and custom code driven by specific projects. This document
will primarily focus on ‘Im2Learn core’ and ‘Im2Learn
extensions’ components. The ‘Im2Learn main’ component allows us
to distribute code configurations according to the needs of
researchers, for example, bio-medical plugins belong to a different
configuration than geo-spatial analysis plugins. The test routines
are an integrated part of code testing in addition to auto-builds
performed every night. Finally, the custom code is a repository of
Im2Learn plugins that are funded by private industry or use libraries
that do not allow code distribution.</p>
