<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The motivation for developing Im2Learn (Image to
Learn) comes from academic, government and industrial collaborations
that involve development of new computer methods and solutions for
understanding complex data sets.  Images and other types of data
generated by various instruments and sensors form complex and highly
heterogeneous data sets, and pose challenges on knowledge extraction.
In general, the driver for the Im2Learn suite of tools is to address
the gap between complex multi-instrument raw data and knowledge
relevant to any specific application.</p>
<p>The objective of the Im2Learn suite of tools is to
research and develop solutions to real life problems in the
application areas of machine vision, precision farming, land use and
land cover classification, map analysis, geo-spatial information
systems (GIS), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target and
multi-spectral scene modeling, video surveillance, bio-informatics,
microscopy and medical image processing, and advanced sensor
environments. The main goal of the Im2Learn research and development
is to automate information processing of repetitive, laborious and
tedious analysis tasks and build user-friendly decision-making
systems that operate in automated or semi-automated mode in a variety
of applications. The development is based on theoretical foundations
of image and video processing, computer vision, data fusion,
statistical and spectral modeling, data mining and pattern
recognition, software engineering and sensor design.</p>
