<h1>Im2Learn User Interface</h1>
<p>The Im2Learn user interface incorporates a
user-friendly front end with mouse-driven operations for selecting an
area of interest and dialog-driven operations for experimenting with
parameter variations. The current visualization capabilities include
image display as a set of still selected frames (gray-scale or
color), movies (temporal sequence of image bands) or plots of
attributes (band values) over a local spatial neighborhood. As part
of the visualization, numerical results can be shown using a scatter
plot tool or a text area dialog.</p>
