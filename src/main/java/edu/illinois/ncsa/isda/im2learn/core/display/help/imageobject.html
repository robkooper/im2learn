<h1>ImageObject</h1>
<p>The heart and soul of Im2Learn is
the ImageObject class. It is used to modify and display the images
and to produce all the abbreviations of it, like segmenting the image
for instance.</P>
<p>The ImageObject class is used to store
information about an image. The image is stored in row major order
with the bands interleaving the pixels (for example an image with 3
rows, 2 columns and 3 bands is stored as RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB where the
first triplet is the pixel at row 1, column 1, the second triplet is
the pixel at row 1, column 2 etc.). ImageObject can be of any
datatype, any number of bands (samples per pixel), rows (height) or
columns (width).</P>
<p>Any additional information about the
image can be stored as a property associated with the image.
Properties that begin with an underscore are temporary properties and
will not be copied when the image is cloned, or saved to disk. Some
common properties have their keys predefined in this class.</P>
<p>How to speed up your application: This
class is an abstract class, any time you call getXXX() it will have
to do a lookup to see what class really to call, and call the
functions on this class. So one speedup is to simply do the check
your self, typecast the ImageObject to the appropriate class and call
the functions on this class. Do this either inside the loop or make
multiple loops for each datatype (still keeping the abstract version
in case a datatype is missing in your implementation). The fastest
way is to use the getData function and typecast the returned object
to the appropriate array (byte[], double[] etc.), this will give you
direct access to the imagedata. If any data is modified computeMinMax
or setMinMaxInvalid will need to be called to mark the fact that the
current minimum and maximum values associated with the image are not
valid.</P>
<p>An ImageObject can also be used to just
store information about an image and will not have any imagedata
associated with it in that case. To test if an ImageObject has any
data, use either getData() or isDataValid(). Accessing one of the get
or set functions when no data is present will throw a NullPointer
exception. No checks are done in the get and set function to see if
there is any imagedata to speed them up.</p>
